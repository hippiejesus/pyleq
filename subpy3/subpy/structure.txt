Flow Control (subc.py): "Control Layer"
- 'if' junction
    -- '<' operator
    -- '>' operator
    -- '<=' operator
    -- '>=' operator
- 'math' operation
    -- '-' signifier
    -- '+' signifier
    -- '=' signifier
- 'literal' interpretation
    -- all sqasm compatible commands
    -- '/l' terminator
- 'comments'
    -- '%' initiator
    -- all characters must be strung together.
    -- can be placed anywhere in a command and on any line

Commands (subsh.py): "Command Shell"
- 'print' command

- 'input' command

- 'print_input' command

Workspace (subm.py): "Space Manager"
- 'buffer' creation
- 'storage' allocation
- 'link library' generation
    -- Link libraries are smaller buffer spaces that contain references to the locations of information in the allocated storage space.
- 'command' replication ("command loading")
    -- Loads subc structure for a command and edits it to be context-specific
    -- Utilized by the command shell to generate subc input.

Modules (/commands/): "Modules"
- Command schemes
- Storage maps

Schema:
    The control layer is utilized as the core component of any subpy operation.
    The command shell interprets higher level commands and uses the space manager to assemble any necessary modules.
    The shell then creates an intermediary file that can be interpreted by the control layer and in turn by sqasm.
    By nature and necessity, any module, as well as any output from the command shell, must be subc compatible.
